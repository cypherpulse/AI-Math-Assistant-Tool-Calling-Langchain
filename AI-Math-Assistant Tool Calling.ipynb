      "Response Content:  Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that fundamentally changes the way information is stored and transferred on the internet. Here's a comprehensive breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Definition: Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across many computers so that any involved record cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks. This decentralized structure brings transparency, security, and resistance to data modification.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Structure: A blockchain is essentially a chain of blocks, each containing data or code. These blocks are linked using cryptography, which ensures the integrity of the data. This structure makes it extremely difficult to change any single record without altering all subsequent blocks, requiring consensus across the network.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Decentralization: Unlike traditional databases, which are usually held in a single location and managed by a central authority, a blockchain is decentralized. The information stored in a blockchain exists as a shared and continually reconciled database. This means that the records it keeps are truly public, easily verifiable, and resistant to control by any single entity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Security: Blockchain technology incorporates several security features. As a distributed system, it has no single point of failure. It is also designed in such a way that once data has been recorded, it's incredibly difficult to change that data, providing a high level of security against data tampering.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Transparency: In a blockchain, all transactions are recorded on a ledger that is available publicly (though with varying degrees of anonymity, depending on the particular blockchain), which allows for transparency in transactions. Each participant in the blockchain has a copy of this ledger, and all transactions are traced in real-time.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Consensus Mechanisms: Blockchain networks rely on consensus mechanisms to validate transactions and add new blocks to the chain. These mechanisms vary from network to network but often involve \"proof-of-work\" or \"proof-of-stake\" processes that help to secure the system and prevent fraud.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Applications: While blockchain technology is perhaps best known for its use in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, it has numerous other applications. These range from smart contracts and supply chain management to identity verification and voting systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology that allows multiple parties to share access to the same data in such a way that no single party controls it. It's secure, transparent, and resistant to fraud, which is why it's being explored for a wide range of uses beyond cryptocurrencies.\n"

    "## Orchestrating multiple tools with an agent: Mathematical toolkit\n",
    "In real-world applications, a single tool is often insufficient to address the complexity and diversity of user requests. Tasks such as data analysis, performing calculations, or retrieving specific information require specialized capabilities that cannot be fulfilled by a single function. By equipping an agent with multiple tools, each tailored to a distinct purpose, you'll create a system that can dynamically select and utilize the appropriate tool based on the user’s query. This approach enhances the flexibility and scalability of the AI, allowing it to handle a broad spectrum of tasks with precision and efficiency. The orchestration of multiple tools ensures that the agent can seamlessly manage complex workflows, making it an essential framework for building robust and versatile AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this concept, let’s create additional tools, i.e, a mathematical toolkit. In addition to the addition tool, you will now create tools for subtraction, multiplication, and division. These tools will be integrated into an agent capable of handling various mathematical queries, showcasing how multiple tools can work together within a single AI system.\n",

These functions are simple - `multiply_numbers` takes a list of numbers in string format and returns their product, while `divide_numbers` takes the first number and divides it by each subsequent number in sequence. Instead of manually wrapping these functions in the Tool class, you'll use the `@tool` decorator to automatically convert them into LangChain tools, using their docstrings as descriptions. These decorated tools can then be added directly to the agent alongside other operations like addition or subtraction, allowing the agent to intelligently select the appropriate operation based on the user's query, making it versatile for handling various math problems.\n"

The add_numbers, subtract_numbers, multiply_numbers, and divide_numbers functions should be updated to handle decimal numbers using float conversion, validate inputs more strictly, and provide clear error messages for edge cases. For example, divide_numbers should explicitly check for division by zero, and all functions should gracefully handle non-numeric inputs like \"two\" or \"hundred\". The test cases should be expanded beyond basic operations to include edge cases like divided by zero, empty inputs, and mixed numeric/text inputs (e.g., \"divide one hundred by 5\").
